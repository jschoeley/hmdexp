Human Mortality Database Explorer
=================================

by *Jonas Schöley*

The [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/) is a widely used tool to study the demographics of death. The HMD-Explorer produces visualizations of the HMD-data based on user queries. Users interact with a webpage, selecting data and immediately seeing the visualizations.

Note: The HMD data is not part of this repository and has to be downloaded separately. In order to do so you need to register at http://www.mortality.org/ and then run `/data_preparation/data_download_and_preparation.R`, inputting you HMD-credentials.
